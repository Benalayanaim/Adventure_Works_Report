IN DATA VISUALIZATION :


Always ask yourself the three key questions
• What type of data are you visualizing, what are you communicating, and who is the end user?


Strive for clarity and simplicity above all else
• “Perfection is achieved not when there’s nothing more to add, but when there’s nothing left to take away”


Focus on creating clear narratives and intuitive user experiences
• Use bookmarks, drillthroughs, tooltips and navigation buttons to seamlessly guide users through reports
